# What is it?

Tools to help visualize, secure, verify network connectivity within your cloud infrastructure.  Also allows you to read AWS cloud configs and output terraform plans to re-create it.

# ... but why?

I found AWS can be pretty daunting even if you have a background in networking.  It seemed pretty hard to get a quick overview of what was going on and possible security settings between hosts.  This helps automate the process.  The ability to output terraform configuration files can help people migrate their existing cloud networks more easily.

# Why not call it AWS Buddy?

I plan to extend the code so it will work with other cloud technologies.  Currently I am most familiar with AWS.
