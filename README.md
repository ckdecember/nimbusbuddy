#What is it?

Tools to help visualize, secure, verify network connectivity within your cloud infrastructure.

#... but why?

I found AWS can be pretty daunting even if you have a background in networking.  It seemed pretty hard to get a quick overview of what was going on and possible security settings between hosts.  This helps automate the process.

# Why not call it AWS Buddy?

I plan to extend the code so it will work with other cloud technologies.  Currently I am most familiar with AWS.
