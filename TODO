Main Features
- powerful Cloud Assistance that lets you
- visualize 
- save configurations
- help restore configurations by piping into terraform 
- save configurations locally, to be version controlled.

Tech
- custom data format/json format to restore configurations
- add support for
    - VPC
    - Subnets
    - EC2 instances 
    - ELB
    - EKS (optional)
    - network acl
    - security groups
    - default gateways

structure for ec2s.
vpc
subnet
ec2
security groups
default gateway (follows subnet?)
Elastic IP - scopes to either VPC or EC2??

save these settings if possible
AWS instantiation toggles
- ami (amazon machine image) -  'ImageId': '',
- num instances - might be a loop of number of instances within reservations/instances.
- network vpc context -  'VpcId':
- subnet normal network - 'SubnetId': ''
- auto assign public ip or not. - CAN'T FIND YET
- placement group? wtf? - UNKNOWN
- capacity - yeah, tower. - HMMM
- iam role - CAN'T FIND ROLE, SO WEIRD
KeyName - but can't really be used in terra??!?
- enable termination protection - PROB NOT
- volume type - VolumeId but this is very specific.
- tags - seems like custom naming, which is very very handy.
- security-group - SecurityGroups[ groupname, groupid], tuples
can you be part of more than one security group?

network ACL 
a network acl can be applied to more than one subnet
security group 
for instances.  can be set in group of instances.


- able to connect to AWS and list VPCs, EC2s, Subnets, which EC2 is in which Subnet.  
- ALSO, parse all regions to check for existing EC2
- Internet Gateways and VPCs

- get a table of all EC2s in EACH regions
- find unused security-groups
- find stale EC2s, and prepare to self destroy
- estimate costs - warn you on average daily (same as billing?)

- maybe AWS config saves? - hard to do 

- focus more on management
- turn down instances or turn up 

- quick dashboard
using tables 




- notes 
boto3.client works only per region, and must be initialized as such.

result is a webpage which is zipped/tarred up and uploaded somewhere or anywhere.
you can deploy/test/view it as a webpage for localbrowser OR webserver

- also dumps a large custom config file of sorts.  one that is visualizable.  
- advantage here is it can be versioned controlled.  you can also replay it back to view your old network
- could also give suggestions on how to rebuild it ORRRRR use TERRAFORM to rebuild it.

- maybe could be versioned?  but not sure.  i suppose it's just text so it can be more easily stored.
- this way you can look at old versions of the config dump so to speak.




List VPCs and the EC2's within

describe_instances()



describe_vpcs()
this finds all vpcs and cidr block associations (indirectly the subnets are here) 

Gateways for each Subnet - this is good to know you can get out and a common problem.

ec2client
describe_route_tables 

populate a dictionary with subnetID is key. value is list of route dicts.
SubnetID is here, so you can match subnet ID with a list of Routes!!!



# get AWS credentials
# get from environment variables
# check for failure on no-auth
#Boto3 will check these environment variables for credentials:
#AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
#AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
#AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
#The session key for your AWS account. This is only needed when you are using temporary credentials. The AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN environment variable can also be used, but is only supported for backwards compatibility purposes. AWS_SESSION_TOKEN is supported by multiple AWS SDKs besides python.

       # gives subnetid, vpcid, ownerid
        # subnets / vpc / route table, network acl, default subnet
        self.client.describe_subnets()
    
    def listInstances(self):
        # ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
        # describe_internet_gateways() - lists exissting ones, but not attached ones to subnets
        
        # ec2 can get internet gateway - ec2.internetgateway
        # this will need filtering
        self.client.describe_instances()
