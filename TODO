Main Features
- powerful Cloud Assistance that lets you
- visualize 
- save configurations
- help restore configurations by piping into terraform 
- @save configurations locally, to be version controlled.
- clean up excessive configurations
    - looks for unused security groups
    - looks for unused elastic IPs (this will be billed if not discovered)
- quick diagnostic tool to help people troubleshoot your network

Tech
- add support for
    - @VPC
    - @Subnets
    - @EC2 instances 
    - security groups
    - default gateways

#Visualization
- VPCs, Subnets - Internet Gateways - Routing Tables, EC2s - SecurityGroups 

# FIX multiple security groups

# short list
- maybe make a display module.  keep pulling down the groups over and over again.  
- pull them all once in a super list.  

Will also need to add extraction for securitygroups and internet gateways as well.

Versioning or storing of older configuration is also on the list, but might get scaled back depending on time.

- add features -> display network
- create terraform config
- save config (custom settings)

resource "aws_internet_gateway" "gw" {
  vpc_id = "${aws_vpc.main.id}"

  tags = {
    Name = "main"
  }
}

# internet gateways
cli.describe_internet_gateways()['InternetGateways'][0]['Attachments'] -> this gives VpcID.

#route tables
>>> cli.describe_route_tables()['RouteTables'][0].keys()
dict_keys(['Associations', 'PropagatingVgws', 'RouteTableId', 'Routes', 'Tags', 'VpcId', 'OwnerId'])
ties subnet id, actual destination, and gateway ids, and vpcs

AWS instantiation toggles
- ami (amazon machine image) -  'ImageId': '',
- num instances - might be a loop of number of instances within reservations/instances.
- network vpc context -  'VpcId':
- subnet normal network - 'SubnetId': ''
- auto assign public ip or not. - CAN'T FIND YET
- placement group? wtf? - UNKNOWN
- capacity - yeah, tower. - HMMM
- iam role - CAN'T FIND ROLE, SO WEIRD

KeyName - but can't really be used in terra??!?
- enable termination protection - PROB NOT
- volume type - VolumeId but this is very specific.
- tags - seems like custom naming, which is very very handy.
- security-group - SecurityGroups[ groupname, groupid], tuples
can you be part of more than one security group? -- yes you can.  and it is PERMISSIVE.

security group 
for instances.  can be set in group of instances.

- ALSO, parse all regions to check for existing EC2
- Internet Gateways and VPCs

- get a table of all EC2s in EACH regions
- find unused security-groups
- find stale EC2s, and prepare to self destroy
- estimate costs - warn you on average daily (same as billing?)

# unit tests for CI/CD runs
