# get AWS credentials
# get from environment variables
# check for failure on no-auth
#Boto3 will check these environment variables for credentials:
#AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
#The access key for your AWS account.
#AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
#The secret key for your AWS account.
#AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
#The session key for your AWS account. This is only needed when you are using temporary credentials. The AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN environment variable can also be used, but is only supported for backwards compatibility purposes. AWS_SESSION_TOKEN is supported by multiple AWS SDKs besides python.

       # gives subnetid, vpcid, ownerid
        # subnets / vpc / route table, network acl, default subnet

        # ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')
        # describe_internet_gateways() - lists exissting ones, but not attached ones to subnets
        
        # ec2 can get internet gateway - ec2.internetgateway
        # this will need filtering
